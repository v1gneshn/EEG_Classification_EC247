# ECE247 Final Project - EEG Classification

This study delves into the analysis of EEG data classification utilizing a variety of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The investigation begins with fundamental architectures such as Deep Convolutional Networks (Deep CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). Subsequently, we explore hybrid models like CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU. Furthermore, we evaluate the effectiveness of cutting-edge architectures, including TSCeption, EEGNet, and ATCNet. These architectures leverage spatio-temporal convolutions and attention mechanisms to enhance classification performance.

Through comprehensive performance evaluation and ablation studies, we analyze trends in classification performance across diverse model architectures, providing valuable insights into their comparative efficacy.
